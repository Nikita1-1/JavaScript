 <h4>Pizza Menu</h4>
 In This project I created a menu with size of pizza and toppings, where you can choose topping that you like and it will give you a price for that pizza.

Classic Tic Tac Toe game. You can play against the computer. As well I added sounds when you place you X in a square and when you Win or loose.
